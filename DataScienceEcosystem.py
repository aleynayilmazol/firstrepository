# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[6]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[7]:


(3*4)+5


# In[8]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60


# In[11]:


minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours


# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - Introduce commonly used libraries in Data Science
# - Create a table of Data Science tools
